# Interview Playground
This repository is used to keep track of my algorithm practice.

Most of the questions come from these books:
  - *Algorithms (4th edition)* by *Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne*
  - *Algorithms (1th edition)* by *Sanjoy Dasgupta et al.*
  - *Cracking the Coding Interview (6th edition)* by *Gayle L. McDowell*

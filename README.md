# Interview Playground
This repository is for keeping track of my practice of writing algorithms.

By now, most of the practicing questions come from these two books
  - *Algorithms (4th edition)* by *Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne*
  - *Cracking the Coding Interview (6th edition)* by *Gayle L. McDowell*
